User is allowed to enter duplicate (and more) records of the same employee.

Expected: User should not be allowed to create a record (First Name, Last Name combination) if it already exists in the database.

Note: In real world 2 people can have the same full name, but then the form must allow for additional field to distinguish employees, e.g. date of birth.
